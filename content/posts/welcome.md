Welcome to OpenOrthoMap! I created this service to keep track of orthophoto maps that I've been making of [Yakushima Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakushima). I've been taking individual photos and using [OpenDroneMap](https://opendronemap.org/) to create orthophoto maps and point clouds -- it's fun -- but I want to do something more with those GeoTIFF files.

That's where this project comes in. I want OpenOrthoMap to be a repository of orthophoto maps taken not only by drones, but airplanes and satellites, allowing free use of the data with attribution. Think OpenStreetMap but instead of vector data, OpenOrthoMap is a repository of raster data.
