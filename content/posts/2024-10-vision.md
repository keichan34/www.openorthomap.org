### Introducing OpenOrthoMap: A New Approach to Organizing Geospatial Data

With OpenOrthoMap (OOM), I'm setting out to create something different in the world of geospatial software—a versatile tool focused not on hosting a massive repository of data, but on helping users organize and manage their own. Unlike OpenAerialMap (OAM) and OpenStreetMap (OSM), which provide comprehensive repositories of open data, OpenOrthoMap’s mission is simpler: to be a lightweight, deployable solution for organizing geospatial data wherever it’s needed.

#### How OpenOrthoMap Stands Out

While both OAM and OSM are critical resources, they revolve around the centralization of open data. OpenOrthoMap, on the other hand, is designed to work with a range of data types, whether open, proprietary, or private. The data available on the [OpenOrthoMap server](https://map.openorthomap.org) is a proof-of-concept rather than a complete data library. The goal is to show OOM’s capability as a tool rather than trying to replicate the vast repositories these projects offer.

#### A Flexible, Lightweight Solution

OpenOrthoMap can be hosted where it’s most useful—whether in the cloud, on a private server, or even on a Raspberry Pi in remote locations. This flexibility makes it ideal for users who work with sensitive or proprietary geospatial data that doesn’t need to be part of a public database. Think of OOM as an adaptable toolkit for organizing and managing data that’s uniquely yours.

#### Short-Term Milestones

In these early stages, here’s what I’m focused on achieving:

1. Launching a cloud version capable of accepting uploads.
2. Creating clear, user-friendly documentation for setting up your own instance.
3. Providing a guide and demo for deploying OpenOrthoMap on a Raspberry Pi, showing its potential for field applications.

#### A Peek at the Future of OOM

As OpenOrthoMap continues to grow, I’ll be sharing more about its architecture and functionality. A central part of my vision is minimizing reliance on traditional databases; for instance, the initial version uses a tool to build an index of static files, keeping the system simple and easy to deploy.

Stay tuned for updates on OpenOrthoMap as we build a solution designed to meet the unique challenges of organizing and managing geospatial data on your terms.
